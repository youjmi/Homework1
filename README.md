# homeWork1
Week 1 HM submission. 

Googled Semantic HTML and usages for them. At first I had really minor problems that others may not find what was wrong, but it was not being able to ID the structure/order. I searched a little more online and found a helpful diagram that showed to me the correct order/structure. I found this method to be cleaner in my opionion. 

Some tags had an ID but not a class and vice versa, and the Search Engine Optimization was not linked. Had to add a couple of changes to that

I changed a couple of codes on CSS to reduce repition by minimizing its length. I found that alot of them were pretty excessive and just taking too much space

In this repo you will find my CSS, HTML, Screenshot and the deployed link to the 
webpage :https://youjmi.github.io/homeWork1/

Thank you!
